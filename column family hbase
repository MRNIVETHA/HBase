HBase is a column-oriented non-relational database management system that runs on top of Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
HBase provides a fault-tolerant way of storing sparse data sets, which are common in many big data use cases.
It is well suited for real-time data processing or random read/write access to large volumes of data.
Unlike relational database systems, HBase does not support a structured query language like SQL; in fact, HBase isn’t a relational data store at all. 
HBase applications are written in Java™ much like a typical Apache MapReduce application. HBase does support writing applications in Apache Avro, REST and Thrift.
An HBase system is designed to scale linearly. It comprises a set of standard tables with rows and columns, much like a traditional database.
Each table must have an element defined as a primary key, and all access attempts to HBase tables must use this primary key.

CONCLUSION :
we can say that Apache HBase is a NoSQL database that runs on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System. Provides the BigTable functionality of the Hadoop framework. 
It consists of HMaster Server, HBase Region Server, and Regions and Zookeeper. 
The article included the difference between HBase and RDBMS as well as the difference between HBase and HDFS. 
HBase provides consistent reads and writes. It is open-source and scalable. We can use HBase in many industries, including medicine, sports, e-commerce, etc.
